# **Project Documentation: Manager-Employee Communication Web Application**

## **1. Overview**

The Manager-Employee Communication Web Application is a collaborative platform designed to streamline communication between managers and employees. The application enables managers to assign tasks to individual employees or groups, provide detailed instructions, set deadlines, and track progress. Employees can communicate with managers, update task status, and provide proof of task completion as needed. The application is built using React for the frontend, PHP for the backend, and MariaDB as the database.

## **2. Key Features**

### **2.1 Task Assignment**
- **Individual and Group Tasks:** Managers can assign tasks to specific employees or groups.
- **Task Details:** Include task description, deadlines, and location information.
- **Task Updates:** Employees can update task status, add notes, and upload proof of completion.

### **2.2 Communication**
- **Task-Specific Communication:** Employees and managers can discuss specific tasks within the task section.
- **General Chat:** Separate chat functionality for non-task-related communication.

### **2.3 User Roles and Permissions**
- **Managers:** Full access to all features, including task assignment, communication, and monitoring.
- **Employees:** Limited access with permissions to view assigned tasks, communicate, and update task status.

### **2.4 Task Monitoring and Proof Submission**
- **Task Monitoring:** Managers can monitor the progress of assigned tasks.
- **Proof Submission:** Employees can be required to submit proof of task completion, such as files or images.

## **3. Technology Stack**

### **3.1 Frontend**
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications (SPA).
- **Chakra UI:** A simple, modular, and accessible component library that provides the building blocks needed to build React applications.

### **3.2 Backend**
- **PHP:** A server-side scripting language used to handle the backend logic, manage sessions, and interact with the database.
- **RESTful API:** The backend will expose a RESTful API to the React frontend for communication.

### **3.3 Database**
- **MariaDB:** An open-source relational database management system, used to store user data, tasks, communication logs, and proof submissions.

## **4. Architecture**

### **4.1 Overview**
The application follows a client-server architecture where the frontend (React) communicates with the backend (PHP) via RESTful APIs. The backend interacts with the MariaDB database to store and retrieve data.

### **4.2 Components**
- **Frontend:** 
  - **Task Management Interface:** Allows managers to create, assign, and monitor tasks, while employees can view, update, and submit proof for their tasks.
  - **Communication Interface:** Task-specific and general chat features.
  - **User Authentication:** Manages login and access control based on user roles.

- **Backend:** 
  - **Task API:** Manages task creation, assignment, updates, and proof submission.
  - **User API:** Handles user authentication, role management, and access control.
  - **Communication API:** Facilitates task-specific and general chat functionalities.

- **Database:**
  - **User Table:** Stores user information, roles, and authentication details.
  - **Task Table:** Stores task details, assignments, deadlines, and status.
  - **Communication Table:** Stores chat logs, both task-specific and general.
  - **Proof Table:** Stores proof of task completion, such as file paths or URLs.

## **5. Detailed Functionality**

### **5.1 User Authentication and Role Management**
- **Login:** Users (managers and employees) log in using their credentials.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** The system checks user roles to determine access levels.

### **5.2 Task Management**
- **Create Task:** Managers can create tasks, specifying the task description, deadline, and location.
- **Assign Task:** Managers can assign tasks to individual employees or groups.
- **View Task:** Employees can view their assigned tasks, including details provided by the manager.
- **Update Task:** Employees can update the task status (e.g., in-progress, completed) and add notes.
- **Proof Submission:** Employees can upload files or images as proof of task completion if required by the manager.

### **5.3 Communication**
- **Task-Specific Chat:** Each task has an associated chat section where employees and managers can discuss the task.
- **General Chat:** A separate chat interface for non-task-related communication between employees and managers.

### **5.4 Task Monitoring**
- **Progress Tracking:** Managers can track the progress of each task based on updates provided by employees.
- **Proof Verification:** Managers can review the proof submitted by employees to confirm task completion.

## **6. User Interface Design**

### **6.1 Chakra UI Components**
- **Responsive Layouts:** The application will be fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes.
- **Accessible Design:** Use Chakra UI's built-in accessibility features to ensure the application is usable by all individuals.
- **Custom Themes:** Leverage Chakra UI's theming capabilities to create a consistent look and feel throughout the application.

### **6.2 Key Pages**
- **Dashboard:** Overview of tasks, recent communications, and quick access to key features.
- **Task Management:** Interface for creating, assigning, and tracking tasks.
- **Task Details:** Detailed view of a specific task, including description, deadlines, chat, and proof submission.
- **Chat:** Separate interfaces for task-specific and general chat.

## **7. Security Considerations**

### **7.1 Authentication**
- **Secure Login:** Implement strong password policies and use HTTPS for secure communication.
- **Session Management:** Ensure secure session management practices to prevent unauthorized access.

### **7.2 Data Protection**
- **SQL Injection Protection:** Use prepared statements and parameterized queries in PHP to protect against SQL injection attacks.
- **Data Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data in the database, such as user passwords and any confidential communication.

### **7.3 Access Control**
- **Role-Based Access:** Ensure that only authorized users can access or modify certain data or features.
- **Audit Logging:** Implement logging for critical actions, such as task assignments, updates, and proof verification.

## **8. Deployment and Maintenance**

### **8.1 Deployment**
- **Server Configuration:** PHP and MariaDB server setup, along with React build deployment.
- **Environment Variables:** Securely manage environment variables for different environments (development, staging, production).

### **8.2 Maintenance**
- **Database Backups:** Regular backups of the MariaDB database to prevent data loss.
- **Software Updates:** Keep the React frontend, PHP backend, and MariaDB database up to date with the latest security patches and features.
- **Monitoring:** Implement monitoring tools to track application performance and identify potential issues.
